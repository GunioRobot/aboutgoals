== AboutGoals

AboutGoals is a proof-of-concept, or spike, project to explore the usefulness
of organising activities (of a team, or your own) by the goals that motivate them.

If it seems useful, I'll be extending by adding APIs for apps like RememberTheMilk or
AgileZen, or Lighthouse, using them as a source of Activities.

== Install

The usual stuff for a rails app. You need your own config/database.yml though you 
can use the default one. Then (assuming you have bundler) do bundle install and
rake db:migrate. Start it up and it should be fairly easy to use.
